            In terms of strength (BST-wise [click the about page for more information]), below are some notable Pokemon that are at the top of list, starting from first place, descending to 50th:

            In the Pokemon game series, there is a competition from Generation III named the Pokemon named the Pokemon Super Contest. In here, players compete in one of five different categories in the competition: Cool Contests, Beauty Contests, Cute Contests, Smart Contests and Tough Contests. In this website, we will mainly focus on Cute Contests and Tough contests. In all these contests, there are three parts: the Visual Competition, the Dancing Competition and the Acting Competition. We will be mainly focusing on the acting competition mostly, as the other's results depend on player input. 
<br><br>
The Acting competition is about Pokemon displaying moves to a judge of the player's choice (out of the 3 judges who are named Keira, Jordan and Dexter [the head judge]) that earns them a certain amount of attention from the judges which is measured in Appeal Points (AP), being portrayed as hearts per 10 AP in the game. However, some moves do not have any AP, but can be compensated for. 
<br><br>
Certain moves also belong to a certain category, which is the category contest it would be best to use in (for example, the move Minimise belongs to the Cute Contest category with an AP of 2), and performing a move in the category contest it belongs to will boost a meter called the Voltage meter by 1. However, performing a non-matching move will cause the player's Voltage meter to go down by 1. When the Voltage Meter has been filled, the pokemon earns bonus AP depending on which judge they performed to. If they performed to Keira or Jordan, they will earn a bonus +5 AP. If they performed to Dexter, they will earn a bonus of +8 AP. Furthermore, a pokemon can earn extra points from judges depending on the conditions they performed in: if only 1 pokemon performed a move, there is a bonus of +3 AP, if two pokemon performed moves, there is a bonus of +2 AP, if three pokemon performed, there is a bonus of +1 AP apiece and if all pokemon performed, no bonus points will be awarded. 
<br><br>
From Generation III, there were only 4 rounds, but it was changed to 5 from Generation IV onwards. Also, another change made from Generation III to Generation IV was that instead of the leader board displaying the best performer first then the worst performer last, it appears inversely (worst performer first, best performer last). 
<br><br>
Below are some excellent moves to use in the Cute and Tough competitions due to their high AP. The ones that have a risk are marked with a ∆ sign and ones that come with the cost of 1 or more move in the next round are marked with a ¢ sign:
