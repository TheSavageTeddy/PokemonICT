            Hello humans. This is a website about cute and strong pokemon! 
            Pokemon are amazing creatures and display a variety of habits, behaviours 
            and looks that make them appear cute or strong! This website will show you 
            a wide range of pokemon that have these attributes. 
        </p>
        <p id="about2">
            These are our mascots! Eternatus on the left hand side represents the strength 
            Part, as it is the pokemon with the best total stats ever, which is equal to a whopping 
            1125! (See below for information on strong and cute pokemon). Shaymin, on the right 
            Side represents the cuteness part, as it has been observed to be as a top rank on cuteness polls 
            and leaderboards. And Mega Diancie has been chosen as our main mascot, as it displays amazing strength 
            (a BST of 700) as well as being very aesthetically pleasing to many.
